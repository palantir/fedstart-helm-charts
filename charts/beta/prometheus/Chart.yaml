description: A Prometheus chart that can be used with Palantir FedStart

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

version: 25.18.0001

# Be aware that using helm dependencies has undesirable side affects, where you cannot remove
# subchart config keys by setting them to null. If this type of configuration override is necessary,
# comment out the dependencies block below. See the following github issue for more details:
# https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9027
