# Fedstart Helm Charts

This repository provides reference implementations of open source helm charts with configurations that will work in Palantir's Fedstart environments. These helm chart configurations are intended to work in environments where cluster wide permissions are heavily restricted and/or unavailable.

## Repository Organization

Charts in this repository are organized into categories based on their production-readiness:

* *Generally Available (GA)* charts are deployed by one or more Palantir Fedstart partners and are expected to be production ready. Users can use these at their own discretion, with no need to ask Palantir before doing so. Generally Available charts are organized under the `charts/ga/<name of helm chart>` directory.
* *Beta* charts have been tested internally and are ready to be tested by Fedstart partners. Users who are interested in deploying a Beta chart should reach out to Palantir before doing so. Beta charts are organized under the `charts/beta/<name of helm chart>` directory.
* *Alpha* charts are works in progress, and have not passed internal Palantir testing. Users who are interested in deploying an Alpha chart should reach out to Palantir to provide details about your use case. Alpha charts are organized under the `charts/alpha/<name of helm chart>` directory.

Each helm chart is structured to have a base chart that contains the Palantir Fedstart specific values.yaml configurations, with the open source chart referenced as a subchart.

Each Helm chart subdirectory should include the LICENSE of the original open source helm chart.

## Versioning

This repository uses chart specific labels to tag versions of each chart. The label structure should following the following convention: `<chart-name>-<oss-version-number><fedstart-version-number>`. Ex: `prometheus-25.10.3002`, where:

* `chart-name` is the name of the Helm Chart, and matches the `charts/<chart-name>` subdirectory. Ie: `prometheus`
* `oss-version-number` is the Chart version number in the open source subchart; ie., the `version` found in `charts/prometheus/charts/prometheus/Chart.yaml`
* `fedstart-version-number` is the version associated with the version of the outer chart found in `charts/<chart-name>` and should be the `version` found in the `chart/<chart-name>/Chart.yaml`. This number should be represented as a monotonically increasing integer with at most 3 digits of padding. The digits used for this version will be reduced if the `<oss-version-number>` uses more than one digit, such that the `<oss-version-number><fedstart-version-number>` portion is always exactly 4 digits.

## Packaging

Each helm chart can be packaged separately and published to a container registry.

```shell
# Build helm dependencies for a single helm-chart product
$ helm dependency build ./charts/<helm-chart-path> --repository-config helm-repositories.yaml

# Package a single helm-chart product
$ helm package -d ./build ./charts/<helm-chart-path>

# Publish the packaged helm-chart to a container registry
# NOTE: You must be logged into the helm repository before trying to push
$ helm push ./build/<packaged-helm-chart> <helm-repository-url>
```

### Example: Using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

The following example packages the [vector](./charts/beta/vector) helm-chart, pushes it to ECR, and creates a new product-release in Apollo.

Pre-requisites:

1. An ECR registry exists with a repository named `vector`
   1. We will use `12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` where `accountID=12345` and `region=us-east-1`
2. `helm`, `aws`, and `apollo-cli` are on the users `$PATH`
3. `apollo-cli` is configured for the correct Apollo hub

From the root of this repository:

```shell
# Build helm dependencies for the vector helm-chart
$ helm dependency build ./charts/beta/vector --repository-config helm-repositories.yaml
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "vector" chart repository

# Package the vector helm-chart
$ helm package -d ./build ./charts/beta/vector
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: build/vector-0.31.1001.tgz

# Get an AWS access-token and log into ECR using helm
$ aws ecr get-login-password | helm registry login --username AWS --password-stdin 12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Login Succeeded

# Push the packaged helm-chart to ECR
$ helm push ./build/vector-0.31.1001.tgz 12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Pushed: 12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vector:0.31.1001
Digest: sha256:83fde30c20f51e3e1a071bddc21d0f0b4662002678dc5eb3b62c666bd0d568b9
```

Once the packaged helm-chart is pushed to the container registry, we can now create an Apollo product-release which will be used to create a helm-chart entity in an Apollo environment.

```shell
$ apollo-cli publish helm-chart \
    --chart-file ./build/vector-0.31.1001.tgz \
    --helm-repository-url "oci://12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vector" \
    --maven-coordinate "com.palantir.vector:vector-aggregator:0.31.1001"
Publishing product release com.palantir.vector:vector-aggregator:0.31.1001 into Apollo ... done
```

## Release Process

Charts in this repository are tagged and released using the [Release Charts](.github/workflows/release.yaml) Github workflow and corresponding [release script](./script/release.sh), where the release name is `<chart-name>-<chart-version>` (e.g. `grafana-7.3.7001`). Every commit to the `develop` branch will trigger the workflow and charts with __any__ changes since the latest git tag are evaluated for a potential release as follows:

1. The chart name and version are extracted from the corresponding `Chart.yaml` to construct the desired release name
2. If a release already exists with the desired name, then no release will be made for this chart.
3. If a release does not exist, then one will be created with the desired name

## Minimizing Vulnerabilities

[Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/) provides hardened container images for many of the charts included in this repository. If you are looking to minimize the number of vulnerabilities detected by Apollo when using these charts, we recommend browsing the [Chainguard Images](https://images.chainguard.dev/) to see if there is a suitable image for your chart (example - [Loki](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/loki/versions).

Apollo and FedStart require that all container images used must have a specific, unique version tag (e.g. version `2.1.9` is acceptable, tags such as `latest` are not). If you do not have a paid plan with Chainguard, only the `latest` tag of the Developer images will be made available for you to pull. If you are still interested in using Chainguard images, you will need to mirror the images into your own repository with specific tags on some frequency. Chainguard’s terms and policies can be found [here](https://www.chainguard.dev/software-license-agreement).

Example usage:

```shell
# Pull the latest version from the Loki developer image
$ docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/loki:latest
latest: Pulling from chainguard/loki
6f125e15421f: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:8c908e667a1fe5b3d90e29eb74a7b40ab6dafd9ac46908ee2f76117aae610575
Status: Downloaded newer image for cgr.dev/chainguard/loki:latest
cgr.dev/chainguard/loki:latest

# Re-tag the image to your own ECR with a specific version tag
$ docker tag cgr.dev/chainguard/loki:latest 12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/loki:1.2.3

# Push the image to your ECR repository
$ docker push 12345.dkr.ecr-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/loki:1.2.3
The push refers to repository [12345.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/loki]
